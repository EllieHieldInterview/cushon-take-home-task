# Decision Log and Outstanding Questions

## Styling

### Component Library

I decided to use Mantine as it is what I have been using most recently

lacking a style guide I decided to just use the colours from the cushon logo for inspiration and tried to choose complementary colours. I have only implemented light mode for this task however in reality I would use mantine's in built theme functionality to allow the user to choose between light and dark mode.

## Routing

I have decided not to implement react router as I wanted to focus in on a single user journey however that is how I would choose to expand the app. Other pages I would consider making tickets for are:

- log in page
